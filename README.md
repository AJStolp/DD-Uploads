The front-end for this app is put together using React

This project is titled DD-Uploads, and it's a web application that I feel has a lot of potential in the real world.

In the world of video games players love to show their skills and crazy awesome game plays with their peers. I wanted to create an site where players can share their experiences with their friends and /or the world.

I have a few iterations in mind for this app. I would like to add what user uploaded each clip, a feature to like, dislike or rate the clip based off emotions(emojis), and have useres be able to access all the clips a specific users has uploaded. 

This app was a huge learning experience. Specifically working with mulit/part form data and making sure that data is getting to the server correctly.
